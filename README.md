GameKitHelperCpp
================

Helper classes for adding Game Center functionality to C++ projects, based on Steffen Itterheim's 'Game Kit Helper'.

Use GKHelperWrapperCpp to subit scores, achievements, load views, and generally communicate with Game Center.

Inherit from GKHDelegate to receive data from Game Center (player info, scores, schievements etc.)

GKCppAlternatives contains a set of C++ structs that can be used as alternatives to Game Kit's Objective-C classes.

For a more in depth tutorial on how to use this class, see my blog post at www.stevebarnegren.com
